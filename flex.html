					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Keeping track of all my cards can be a hassle. I don't always want to bring my wallet with me if I am going out to an event or concert. All the facilities on campus are tied to my student ID, which makes losing/forgetting it a major issue. Having an all-in-one identification and payment platform was the natural solution.</p>

					<h3>The Pitch</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Flex is an all-in-one digital wallet solution that combines mobile pay and mobile identification storage in one platform. Flex uses RFID technology to transfer information efficiently and securely, all from your smartphone or smartwatch.</p>

					<h3>The Process</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The creative process started with brainstorming and competetive analysis. This was followed by user studies, interviews, and storyboards to identify painpoints within user flows. Next was site mapping and low fidelity wire framing for mobile and desktop. After copious user testing and UI revision, I moved on to branding and visual design. Finally, I created high fidelity interactive mockups that went through several phases of user testing and feedback. From concept to creation, Project Flex provided firsthand experience with varying stages of development in an entrepreneurial setting.
